# SideLoader - Extended Effects

A small addition to SideLoader allowing mod developers more flexibility when creating mods using SideLoader.

You would include this mod as dependcy of your own mod, as is often done with SideLoader already. 

Dependency string can be found on [ThunderStore page](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/SLExtendedEffects/SideLoader_ExtendedEffects/)
