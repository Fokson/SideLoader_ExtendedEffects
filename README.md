# SideLoader - Extended Effects v1.1.2

### Currently there is a bug with SideLoaderExtendedEffects where the values are not saved when applying values and pressing "Save to XML" from the SideLoader UI from within the game.
This is a problem with SideLoader Extended Effects and not SideLoader iteself, I plan to resolve this soon. 

Working with XML files in a texteditor still works fine for now.

A small addition to SideLoader allowing mod developers more flexibility when creating mods using SideLoader.

You would include this mod as dependcy of your own mod, as is often done with SideLoader already. 

Dependency string can be found on [ThunderStore page](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/SLExtendedEffects/SideLoader_ExtendedEffects/)
